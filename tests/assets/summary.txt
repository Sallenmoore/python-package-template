In the absurd theater of life, a dog finds itself impaled on a garden fork at the stroke of midnight, a spectacle as bizarre as it is tragic. The dog, seemingly caught in a dreamy sprint, is in fact dead, its life presumably ended by the very fork that now anchors it to the earth. The narrator, in a display of morbid curiosity, rules out other causes of death, such as cancer or a road accident, because who in their right mind would skewer a dog post-mortem? Yet, the certainty of this conclusion remains elusive, a testament to the inherent uncertainty and absurdity of existence.
